Hello! 

Please add desired CVS columns into "usethis.cvs" For example, copy the first 256 items in Column B and paste into "usethis.csv" column A. Then run "cvs.sh" in terminal. This will generate an "output.txt" file for the CVS file. Make sure to replace [] with {} when copying into code.

Use this in terminal: ./cvs.sh
Or this in terminal: sudo ./cvs.sh
